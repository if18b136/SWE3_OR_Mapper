TODO decide on inheritance database style - single table, table per type - probably table per type
TODO check if prepared statements would make sense.
TODO refactor table creation - currently takes path to class as table name
TODO add int primary key auto incrementation
TODO look up annotation as metadata for classes
TODO foreign key constraints - "before saving foreign key constraint changes save the object itself" - Lang (VO2)

Locking - singleton class for db operations, which locks itself if a db statement is sent to it, stores other sent states into a waiting room list, which will be handled after unlocking db again.
Big problem with this is that statement 1 could be "delete table x" and statement 2 could then be "insert into table x" - so this solution would need to check in before each waiting room statement if the statement is legal anymore.
